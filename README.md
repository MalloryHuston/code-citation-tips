# Code Citation Tips #

When writing code, you want to use similar citation ideas as in academic writing instances. Whether you are copying or adapting code from a small snippet or using an entire module or function, you must cite your source.

Your citation should include:

* URL of your source                                                      
* Date you retrieved your source
* Title of the program or application you are using     
* Type (eg. source code, application, full program, etc)
* Author name(s) if available
* Code version if available

Here are two methods for citing code from a snippet used from <b>http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource</b> retrieved on December 2, 2020:

1. You can cite your code in your written report or your README file. Here is an example on how to cite code in a written document:
    
    <b>Sample Format</b>: <author name(s)> (&lt;date retrieved&gt;) <title of application/source code/program> (&lt;Version of code&gt;) [&lt;type of      code&gt;]. Source Web address or publisher information.<br>
    <b>Example</b>: Safonte, D (December 2020) Citing source code (Version 1.0) [Source code] <b>http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource</b></br>

2. The second method cite your source right within your code using comments.

    <b>Example</b>: a good citation can be observed on lines 1-4 below:
    
```
1       # Citation for the following function:
2       # Date: 12/02/2020
3       # Copied from /OR/ Adapted from /OR/ Based on:
4       # Source URL: http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource
5
```
