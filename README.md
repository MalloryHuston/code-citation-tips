# Code Citation Tips #

When writing code, you want to use similar citation ideas as in academic writing instances. Whether you are copying or adapting code from a small snippet or using an entire module or function, you must cite your source.

Your citation should include:

* URL of your source                                                      
* Date you retrieved your source
* Title of the program or application you are using     
* Type (e.g., source code, application, full program)
* Author name(s) if available
* Code version if available
* License (if the code you copied has a "copyleft" license)
  * A <ins>copyleft license</ins> lets you use and change code freely, but if you share your version, you must keep it open so others can use and change it too

### Web URL

Here are two methods for citing code from a snippet used from the website, <b>http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource</b>, retrieved on December 2, 2020:

1. You can cite your code in your written report or your `README.md` file. Here is an example on how to cite code in a written document:
    
    <b>Sample Format:</b> <author name(s)> (&lt;date retrieved&gt;) <title of application/source code/program> (&lt;Version of code&gt;) [&lt;type of      code&gt;]. <b>Source web address</b>. Licensed under &lt;license name&gt; (if known).</br>
    
    <b>Example:</b> Safonte, Darreon (December 2, 2020) Citing Source Code (Version 1.0) [Source Code]. <b>http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource</b>. Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</br>

3. The second method cite your source right within your code using comments.

    <b>Example:</b> a good citation can be observed on lines 1-10 below:
    
```
1       # Citation for the following function:
2		# Author: Darreon Safonte
3		# Title: Citing Source Code
4		# Version: 1.0
5		# Type: Source Code
6		# License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
7       # Date retrieved: December 2, 2020
8       # Copied from /OR/ Adapted from /OR/ Based on:
9       # Source URL: http://www.oregonstate.edu/mysource
10		# Note: Adapted from original to fit our use case (e.g., added error handling)

### Publisher

Now, here are two methods for citing code from an application created by its publisher — <b>Oregon State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</b> — retrieved on September 4, 2025:

1. You can cite your code in your written report or your `README.md` file. Here is an example on how to cite code in a written document:
    
    <b>Sample Format:</b> <author name(s)> (&lt;date retrieved&gt;) <title of application/source code/program> (&lt;Version of code&gt;) [&lt;type of      code&gt;]. <b>Source publisher information</b>. Licensed under &lt;license name&gt; (if known).</br>
    
    <b>Example:</b> Ankrah, Jemmy (September 4, 2025) Code Attribution Toolkit (Version 2.1) [Application]. <b>Oregon State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</b>. Licensed under MIT.</br>

2. The second method cite your source right within your code using comments.

    <b>Example:</b> a good citation can be observed on lines 1-10 below:
    
```
1       # Citation for the following function:
2		# Author: Jemmy Ankrah
3		# Title: Code Attribution Toolkit
